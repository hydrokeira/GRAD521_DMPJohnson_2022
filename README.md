# GRAD521_DMPJohnson_2022

This data management plan focuses on data collected during the summer of 2021 under an NSF INTERNS internship with LBNL at a DOE funded study site near Crested Butte, CO. The broader research is part of the Critical Zone Observatory Network, although I am especially interested in understanding how groundwater, and specifically, groundwater-surface water interactions will change across different environments under warming conditions. This research was collected to answer the question: How do monsoon rains influence subsurface flowpaths and groundwater contribution? The data was collected in Coal Creek, a sub-alpine headwater stream to the Upper Colorado River. This watershed receives about 80% of its precipitation of snow, although rain (in the form of monsoons) can play a large part in streamflow generation later in the summer after contributions of snowmelt have declined. Monsoon rains are expected to become more important for streamflow generation as climate change will decrease snow accumulation. Here, we attempted to unravel the local scale factors, including fractures and beaver activity, that impact the complex relationships and processes that contribute to streamflow generation throughout the summer.
